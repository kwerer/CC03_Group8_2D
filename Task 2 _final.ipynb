    "Features considered:\n",
    "1. new_cases_smoothed_per_million\n",
    "    - The number of new cases directly corresponds to the community transmission of COVID-19, giving a clear indication of the prevalence of virus in the community\n",
    "    - Higher number of new cases signals high transmission rates in the community, leading to higher stringency index to keep new cases low\n",
    "2. total_cases_per_millon\n",
    "    - Total numnber of infected individuals is an indication of how many people in the community have natural immunity to COVID-19\n",
    "    - Higher total cases will lead to herd immnunity, leading to lower stringency index\n",
    "3. new_deaths_smoothed_per_million\n",
    "    - Indicates the number of new deaths, an important indicator that is in line with Singapore's stance to be COVID resilient with keeping daily death rates low\n",
    "    - Higher death rates will signal that the virus is becoming more deadly, leading to a higher stringency index to keep people safe\n",
    "4. new_tests_smoothed_per_thousand\n",
    "    - Indicates the number of test done each day, a higher number of testing done will help to ensure that positive cases are picked up earlier and therefore isolated and reduce the spread of the virus\n",
    "    - Higher number of new tests will lower transmissibility leading to stringency index lowering\n",
    "5. positive_rate\n",
    "    - Indicates the percentage of test done that are positive, will give an indication of how many cases are there in the community that is transmitted without being picked up\n",
    "    - Higher postive rates with higher reservoir of undetected cases will lead to stringency index increasing\n",
    "6. people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred\n",
    "    - Indicates how many people are fully vaccinated and therefore lowering the chances of death as well as having a shorter infectious period, leading to slower transmission rates\n",
    "    - Higher vaccination rates gives lower death rate and lower transmissibility will likely lead to lower stringency index\n",
